# Thamognya Overlay

This is my overlay with packages I write and test before making a pr to gentoo/gentoo or bugs.gentoo.org . This may or may not contain packages in the main repo, but they will usually be a version bump, eapi bump, new package or etc.

## Installation of overlay 

### adding this overlay

#### Eselect

`eselect repository add thamognya`

#### Layman

`layman -a thamognya`

## packages

I really reccomend you look at the ebuilds yourself before installing
